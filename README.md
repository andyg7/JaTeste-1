# JaTesté [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jaredweiss/JaTeste.svg?token=QpSsWgv7q6ApQ36qVQqz&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jaredweiss/JaTeste)

JaTesté is a language that makes test-driven development a lot simpler. It's kind of like C, but with the added security of having a well-defined format for writing tests. We started working on JaTesté as a project for our compilers class at Columbia and now the semester is over, we're proud to share it with the world!

Read more about JaTesté in our [docs](/docs/) folder and for a complete overview of the language have a look at the JaTesté [reference manual](/reference_manual/reference_manual.pdf)!
